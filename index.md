*Hi, I'm Sami*. Nice to meet you.

# Objective
Design and hospitality is at the forefront of my career path. My experience in fast-paced studio environments has taught me the importance of group collaboration and the sharing of ideas to develop meaningful designs. To me, a team that delivers extraordinary work and a vibrant learning environment excels in the creative design process. To add to that conversation and to work with like-minded individuals is what keeps me inspired and motivated to create.
